#### Abstract

The goal of this project was to model the stock prices of Exxon Mobil. The model was generated using ARIMA and time series forecasting modules in Alteryx and fed into a linear regression. The output of the linear regession was then exported to tableau for a what-if analysis. Below is the screenshot of the dashboard, where the modeled stock prices is transposed onto the actual stock prices. A limited number of predictor parameters (future month, crude oil, gas, CPI) are made availbe to dynamically change. The dashboard will update the predicted stock price based on the changed parameters.
